# Tensor2Tensor Colab

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/blob/master/tensor2tensor/notebooks/hello_t2t.ipynb 

Tensor2Tensor, or T2T for short, is a library of deep learning models and datasets designed to make deep learning more accessible and accelerate ML research. T2T is actively used and maintained by researchers and engineers within the Google Brain team and a community of users. This colab shows you some datasets we have in T2T, how to download and use them, some models we have, how to download pre-trained models and use them, and how to create and train your own models.

## Install deps
